Hotel comes from the word hostel, said to be taken from old French. This public building has been touted since the late 17th century. It means roughly, "a shelter for migrants" or it could also be "to build a provider of accommodation and food for the public". So, at first the hotel was created to serve the public.

In an era where technology has developed rapidly as it is today, where many businesses have implemented the implementation of information systems as a support for their business, of course it has become commonplace for a business to use the implementation of information systems. But unfortunately, there are still many business processes that do not yet use the implementation of information systems, even though the business processes they do are relatively vulnerable and in dire need of technological assistance. These deficiencies include:

1. Recording of room provision is still using the manual method.
2. Recording of food sales still uses the manual method.
3. Records of room supply and food sales are lost or damaged because they are still written on paper.
4. Human error that may occur, which can cause losses.
5. Manual recording of incoming and outgoing goods stock.
