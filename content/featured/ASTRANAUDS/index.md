PT Akebono Brake Astra Indonesia is a company engaged in the manufacturing industry that produces vehicle components, especially car and motorcycle break systems. This company has a very large land area of 36,910m2. This resulted in the logistical processes occurring at this company requiring more effort and time from the manpower. Therefore, this company wants to create the latest technological innovation by using drones as vehicles for delivering goods between plants and factory warehouses in order to streamline the logisticsprocess that occurs.

In this research, we try to create an IOT-based information system that is integrated with drones. This system functions to control drones remotely by providing point-to-point flight assignments or missions between warehouses and plants in the company and monitoring the surrounding conditions via live streaming video.
