This application is based on Android and uses an API with the Java Spring framework which was created using the Android Studio and IntelliJ IDEA tools. This application has a feature for making reports and complaints submitted by residents of the Astra Polytechnic dormitory to the manager. Previously, the delivery of complaint reports was not well coordinated because they were sent privately via the messaging application (Whatsapp) to the dormitory administrators.

With this application, it is hoped that the business process for making complaint reports at the Astra Polytechnic dormitory can run more effectively and efficiently because it applies the automation method.
